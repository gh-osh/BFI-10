## BFI-10 - The Big Five Inventory 10 Item Scale REDCap instrument


The BFI-10 is a 10-item scale measuring the Big Five personality traits Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, and Openness. The scale was developed based on the 44-item Big Five Inventory (BFI-44; John, Donahue, & Kentle, 1991; Rammstedt, 1997) and designed for contexts in which respondentsâ€™ time is severely limited. Test-retest correlations suggest acceptable reliability. Correlations with other Big Five instruments, correlations between self and peer ratings, and associations with sociodemographic variables suggest good validities of the BFI-10 scores.
